<p> Maverick is a chatbot that supports 4 different Environments : <br>
<ul>
	<li>Weather Forecast Details</li>
	<li>Star Wars Role playing Game</li>
	<li>Cat - gifs (More fun stuff in v2) </li>
	<li>Dog - gifs (More fun stuff in v2)</li>
</ul>
<br> Its a chat application that recieves the input from user - interprets it - if its in a valid language - perform appropriate actions. The user's input is processed through Natural Language Processing of recast.ai that further learns and grows on its own.
<br> I built this using ReactJS and Material Design Lite. This was a fun project - there were certain complications of file structure and setting of memory objects so that the converstation is on the same message thread. At first I was going to build a basic one - weather chatbot but it was pretty easy and less challenging. Scaling it to support 4 different Environment helped me get better understanding of how the state operates in React. <br> I plan on restructuring the codebase and using Redux to manage the state - in v2. Feel free to leave me any feedback on the github page or through email/tweet.
