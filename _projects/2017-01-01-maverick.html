<div class="mdview"><h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>
<p>This project is inspired by Facebook's <a href="http://poncho.is/">http://poncho.is/</a> chat application that fetches weather details for the specified location. I wanted to understand how Natural Language Processing (NLP) interprets user input and AI performs some action with it. Initally I started with <a href="https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural">https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural</a> Natural to process user's input but handling different set of responses became harder. Then i tried a few AI services( wit.ai , api.ai , recast.ai ). Wit needed some server side configuration as they didn't support none-cors request. Api.ai required a premium plan, ended up using Recast.ai - Also it was the easiest to set up and get started with. They have some great blog resources too.   </p>
<h3 id="what-it-does">What it does</h3>
<p>This app is divided into 4 environments :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Maverick environment is responsible to handle different weather requests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Star Wars is a role playing game similar to <a href="https://github.com/RecastAI/starwarsbot">https://github.com/RecastAI/starwarsbot</a>. I tweaked it to support more set of inputs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cats and Dogs - meow and bark back respectively and they fetch random gifs from giphy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understanding of React states and top-down dataflow.</li>
<li>Separation of logical and presentational components. </li>
<li>One state object passed to relevant child components. </li>
<li>Brief understanding NLP and AI concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-s-next">What's next</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support more operations.</li>
<li>Optimize responses - Dont fetch weather for the second time if we already have it.</li>
<li>Support complex AI logic - something with A* algorithm.</li>
<li>Better bot responses.</li>
</ul>
