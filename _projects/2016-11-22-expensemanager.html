<p> I used PouchDB as the primary database for this project. At first I had to brush up some database concepts on storing JSON with unique id and categories so that I can build my app around it. It was not as easy as frontend but after a few hours I got it to work - the real tough part was updating the JSON through react state change. <br><br>This is v1 of the app, I plan on making this much better by using some state management system like - <strong>Redux.</strong> Feel free to play with it and use it to store your expenses - It works <strong>Offline too.</strong>
