<p>MarkdownEditor helps to edit markdown files and see the changes in real time. Markdown files can be downloaded to save as .md file on local computer. I built it using ReactJS to understand the flow of data from parent component to child components. This project was featured on freecodecamps as a beginner level challenge.
