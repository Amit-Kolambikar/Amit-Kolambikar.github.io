 Developed a chrome extension that was similiar to Momentum. It replaced the behavior of new tab with a choice of scenic background music - rain , ocean , mountain etc and rotating wallpapers.

I published it in January 2016, but I had to remove it later as the browsers updated and I didn't have much time to update my app.
